        <p class="quote">2 And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled
            there. 3 And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had
            brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower
            with its top in the heavens(...) <b>Genesis 11:2-4</b></p>

            structures and frame structures. In biological forms, nature adds material where is needed and removes
            materials where is not required
