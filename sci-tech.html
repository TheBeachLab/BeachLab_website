            <p>SELF-ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES</p>
            <p>
                There is inherent beauty in structural forms. Structures have a strong connection with geometry and
                math.
                Nature came out with three strategies to resist loads; Mass structures, shell
                structures and frame structures. In biological forms, nature adds material where is needed and removes
                material where is not required. With several millions of years in research and development, nature
                already
                solved the problems engineers are facing today. We can simulate this behaviour with the help of the
                finite
                element method and Bi-directional Evolutionary Topology Optimization (BESO). Beyond a computer
                simulation,
                digital fabrication will make possible to generate modular structural components that move across to
                resist
                loads as they change on the structural system.

            <p>SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS</p>
            <p>Many people feel surprised when they learn that buildings and construction processes contribute to
                <strong>nearly 40% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and more than a third of the global energy
                    consumption</strong>. I became LEED Accredited Proffesional in Buiding Design and Construction while
                I
                was leading a Hotel project located in Barcelona area. Spain. One day, I
                asked myself <em>What if we create the most sustainable buiding ever designed?</em>.
            </p>
            <p>This is how Mim, a four star Hotel, run by a small family company, became the first LEED Platinum
                certified Hotel in Europe
                and
                the one with a higgest scorecard on Earth, without breaking the bank.</p>

            <p>MICROSHELTERS</p>
            <p>According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, <em>everyone has the right
                    to a
                    standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including
                    (...)
                    housing</em>. A typical building takes around two years to be built, involves huge human resources,
                time and
                money, resulting in an unaffordable privilege to a rising amount of people. Moreover inequality in the
                distribution of services across tne territory, paired with inflexible buiding codes generate even more
                demand and tension.</p>
            <p>Project Nest is an innovative housing concept based on sustainability, technology and modular design.
                Initially aimed to the market of a single person, it grows and shrinks as life needs evolve. With the
                help
                of modern computing and digital fabrication, and a vast trajectory in traditional real estate, a group
                of
                talented people are set to change housing and communities to match human rights standards.</p>.

            <p>My first computer was a Sinclair Spectrum ZX. It used BASIC language, but I had a crush with LOGO, a
                language
                that allowed you to easily draw shapes on the screen. Before the Internet, me and my brothers used to
                connect to BBS's through a landline telephone and a dialup modem.</p>
            <p>I now use Linux computers. I am in love with the beauty and simplicity of UNIX based operating systems
