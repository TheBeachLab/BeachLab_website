        <p>WHO AM I</p>
        <p>I like to define myself as a Civil Engineer 'with feelings'. I am temporarily walking the journey
            of life like a shooting star
            in slow motion. And to answer your question, my name is Fran Sanchez, I am the
            Spirit behind The Beach Lab.</p>
        <p>THIRST FOR LEARNING</p>
        <p>Measured by traditional education standards, I could probably be tagged one of the worst -if not the worst-
            student
            in
            my University. Which is kind of interesting, because I love learning. I used to skip class to run to the
            library. I was
            debouring books, any kind of book. The more I read,
            the more I want to know. It's a sense of urgency. So much to learn, so little time. I never start a book
            from the first page, I open a random one. Sometimes I read backwards, sometimes I scan words jumping across
            chapters,
            sometimes I jump into another book. That's is how I ended up doing so different and apparently unrelated
            things, From Ocean Yatchmaster, to
            engineering, to music and arts, to entepreneurship and many more to come. And yet, I could probably be one
            of
            the worst student in my
            University.</p>


        <p>PASSION FOR DISCOVERY</p>
        <p>The hidden, the quest, the hints. From the astronomy to microscopic world. Along history we have forgotten
            and rediscovered. Ancient civilizations keep undiscovered knowledge. Mistic and out of logic, things we
            cannot find an explanation but we cannot ignore them because we don't </p>
        <p>LOVE FOR NATURE</p>
        <p>There's something about this planet that produces a strong feeling on me. It goes beyond any logic
            fascination. It is some sort of energy encoded in every organic and inorganic matter. Even now I can feel
            it. It's in every drop of the seas, in every dust particle of a mountain, in the air we breathe. It's in
            what we can see and it's in what we can't. It's everywhere, and I love it. I love this planet and I will
            stand for it. I am not giving up on Earth, I am not looking forward to go to Mars. I will use all my
            intelligence, all my skills, all my forces, all the energy I borrowed, to preserve, improve and leave this
            planet a better place than I found it. I will transmit my sons the passion I have for nature so the cycle
            will continue. That is my manifesto.</p>
        <p>CURIOSITY FOR CULTURES</p>
        <p>Blend like an Octopus. Flow like the Wind. Absorb like a Sponge. I am lucky enough to have a job that
            allows me to experience very diverse and rich cultures across the World. For me it's so important to
            understand and
            embrace other people's cultures. It's not only about the treasure of wisdom, but also encounter new forms of
            intelligence. Intelligence adopts many formats, sometimes very subtle. On the dark side, neglecting other
            cultural beings lead to
            missunderstandings, fear and hate. The perfect ingredients for people's manipulation and one of our modern
            societies sins. Cultural awareness balances three fundamental concepts.
            <strong>Identity</strong> has an inbound attractor that seeks the uniqueness of the group or invididual.
            <strong>Diversity</strong>, on the
            other side, is an outbound force that repels from any other. A thirt element,
            <strong>Complementarity</strong>,
            gives balance and harmony to the whole. The beauty of multiculturalism is that you don't need to abandon
            your own culture to love, appreaciate and respect other people's cultures.
