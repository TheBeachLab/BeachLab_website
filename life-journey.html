            <p>WHO AM I</p>
            <p>I like to define myself as a Civil Engineer 'with feelings'. I am walking the journey
                of life like a shooting star
                in slow motion. And to answer your question, my name is Fran Sanchez, the
                Spirit behind The Beach Lab.</p>

            <p>THIRST FOR LEARNING</p>
            <p>Measured by traditional education standards, I could probably be tagged one of the worst -if not the
                worst-
                student
                in
                my University. Which is kind of interesting, because I love learning. I used to skip class to run to the
                library. Libraries are my kind of place. I
                devour books, any kind of book. The more I read,
                the more I want to know. It's a sense of urgency. So much to learn, so little time. I never start a book
                from the first page, I open a random one. Sometimes I read backwards, sometimes I scan words jumping
                across
                chapters,
                sometimes I jump into another book. That's is how I ended up doing so different and apparently unrelated
                things, From Ocean Yatchmaster and diving, to
                engineering and math, to music and arts, to entepreneurship and many more to come. And yet, I could
                probably
                be one
                of
                the worst student in my
                University.</p>

            <p>NEED FOR DISCOVERY</p>
            <p><i>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.<br>
                    <b>Marcel Proust</b></i></p>

            <p>The day I sequence my DNA I will check for a gene known as 7R. In 2013, National Geographic highlighted
                that
                this particular gene is a critical marker for an explorer. Feeling joy when traveling to remote
                locations is
                just a consequence of it. Exploration is about feeling comfortable with the unknown, the hidden. It's
                about
                experiencing pleasure in the quest rather than the discovery itself. It's about becoming a pioneer by
                unwinding the hints you find on the way. It applies to every aspect in life. You are an explorer when
                you
                develop your own tools and computer software rather than using existing solutions. You are an explorer
                when
                you prefer looking through the eyepiece of a telescope or a microscope rather than accessing a catalog
                of
                images. You are an explorer when you seek for forgotten wisdom in ancient civilizations. You are an
                explorer
                when you try to solve the misteries of mystic and out of logic phenomena. Exploration is the essence of
                humanity.</p>

            <p>LOVE FOR NATURE</p>
            <p>There's something about this planet that produces a strong feeling on me. It goes beyond any logic
                fascination. It is some sort of energy encoded in every organic and inorganic matter. Even now I can
                feel
                it. It's in every drop of the seas, in every dust particle of a mountain, in the air we breathe. It's in
                what we can see and it's in what we can't. It's everywhere, and I love it. I love this planet and I will
                stand for it. I am not giving up on Earth, I am not looking forward to go to Mars. I will use all my
                intelligence, all my skills, all my forces, all the energy I borrowed, to preserve, improve and leave
                this
                planet a better place than I found it. I will transmit my sons the passion I have for nature so the
                cycle
                will continue. That is my manifesto.</p>

            <p>PASSION FOR CULTURES</p>
            <p>Blend like an Octopus. Flow like the Wind. Absorb like a Sponge. I am lucky enough to have a job that
                allows me to experience very diverse and rich cultures across the World. For me it's so important to
                understand and
                embrace other people's cultures. It's not only about the treasure of wisdom, but also encounter new
                forms of
                intelligence. Intelligence adopts many formats, sometimes very subtle. On the dark side, neglecting
                other
                cultural beings lead to
                missunderstandings, fear and hate. The perfect ingredients for people's manipulation and one of our
                modern
                societies sins. Cultural awareness balances three fundamental concepts.
                <strong>Identity</strong> has an inbound attractor that seeks the uniqueness of the group or invididual.
                <strong>Diversity</strong>, on the
                other side, is an outbound force that repels from any other. A third element,
                <strong>Complementarity</strong>,
                gives balance and harmony to the whole. The beauty of multiculturalism is that you don't need to abandon
                your own culture to love, appreaciate and respect other people's cultures.
